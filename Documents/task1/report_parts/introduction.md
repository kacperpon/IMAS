# Design of a Multi-Agent System for Emergency Response Simulation in Urban Environments: Task 1.

## 1. Introduction

This is the report for Task 1, which presents the initial design of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) for managing emergency responses in an urban city. The objective of this project is to simulate a coordinated response among various autonomous agents to solve rescue scenarios which may contain fires, medical injuries, traffic management, etc. The environment will be carefully selected to emulate the real-world challenges and complexities of emergency management, including the optimization of resource allocation to ensure a precise and timely response by the emergency crews.

In this design phase, we focus on analyzing the environment, selecting and defining crews and agent roles, and classifying the agents within the system. The environment includes critical components such as fire trucks, ambulances, hospitals and other emergency services, each positioned and equipped based on realistic constraints. Our agents are structured into dedicated crews, each responsible for distinct aspects of the emergency response, including emergency coordination, fire containment, medical support, and ethical analysis.


Concretely, our MAS system contains 5 crews: Emergency crew, Ethics crew, Firefighting crew, Medical crew, and Police crew. Each of them is responsible for a different set of challenges of the rescue operation and as such, their corresponding agents have very different properties and goals. Furthermore, each crew has its own hierarchy to manage the plans for for its own subset of goals.

Overall, this preliminary analysis aims to establish a solid foundation for further development by defining the agentsâ€™ capabilities, their basic interactions (to be expanded in Task 2), and the structure of the MAS. This activity sets the foundations for the future design activities where coordination mechanisms and implementation details will be refined to obtain the overall goal of implementing a realistic model of this described scenario.

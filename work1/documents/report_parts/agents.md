The emergency crew consists of two key agents. The Contact agent receives reports in natural language and compiles the data in JSON format to pass it to the organization agents. It is a Facilitator type agent and uses the FileReadTool. The Planner agent receives the plans from each organization agent and compiles them into a global plan, consulting with the ethics crew in case there are ethical dilemmas. It is also a Facilitator type agent.
The ethics crew features the Philosopher agent, which receives ethical dilemmas from the emergency planner and solves them using RAG to extract conclusions from an ethics "book" (text file). It is a Facilitator type agent and utilizes the FileReadTool.
The firefighting crew is led by an Organization Agent that receives structured information from the emergency contact agent and creates task lists considering available resources and emergency distances. It sends its plan to the emergency planner agent, and once the whole plan is compiled, it passes tasks to actuators. This agent is a Facilitator type with both deliberative capabilities (making general plans without full environment details) and reactive abilities (changing plans based on emergency evolution). It uses the DistanceMetricTool. The crew includes three Firefighter Actuator Agents who fight fires and three Rescue Actuator Agents who rescue people. Both types are Actuator agents with hybrid capabilities, allowing them to follow plans while making small decisions independently, and reactive abilities to adapt to emergency evolution.
The medical crew is structured similarly, with an Organization Agent that receives structured information and creates task lists based on resources and distances. It is a Facilitator type agent with deliberative capabilities and uses the DistanceMetricTool. The crew includes three Med Actuator Agents who provide first aid to victims and three Driver Actuator Agents who operate ambulances. Both are Actuator type agents with hybrid capabilities.
The police crew is led by an Organization Agent that receives structured information and determines alternative routes around fire-blocked roads. It is a Facilitator type agent with deliberative capabilities and uses the DistanceMetricTool. The crew includes three Patrol Actuator Agents who operate patrol cars and manage traffic and evacuation. These are Actuator type agents with hybrid capabilities.

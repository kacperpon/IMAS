# Emergency Response System Workflow

## 1. Initial Emergency Report & Assessment

The emergency response process initiates when a report is received by the system. Emergency services immediately gather structured information through a detailed Markdown report. This report is essential as it contains comprehensive details about the incident: the specific classification of the fire (whether it's ordinary, electrical, or gas-based), the exact location marked by X and Y coordinates, a count of people who have been injured in the incident, and a clear assessment of the fire's severity, categorized as low, medium, or high.

## 2. Strategic Planning

### Initial Distribution

Upon receiving this information, the emergency service swiftly develops a preliminary general plan. This plan is then systematically distributed to three key specialized departments: the Firefighting Crew, Medical Team, and Police Department. Each department receives relevant aspects of the plan pertaining to their specific roles and responsibilities.

### Specialized Planning

After receiving the initial plan, each department's organizational agents begin developing their own optimized response strategies. The Firefighting team creates a detailed plan considering the specific characteristics of the fire and the resources at their disposal. The Medical team focuses their planning on effective casualty management and coordination with nearby hospitals. Meanwhile, the Police department develops comprehensive strategies for traffic control that might be necessary.

## 3. Plan Integration & Approval

Following the specialized planning phase, all individual plans are brought together at the Emergency Services level for consolidation. When necessary, an ethical review is conducted to ensure all planned actions meet required standards and guidelines. Once approved, a comprehensive final plan is crafted, incorporating all specialized elements, and distributed back to all teams for execution.

## 4. Operational Execution

### Team Deployment

With the final plan approved, all actuator agents, representing the field units, execute their assigned tasks. Firefighting units proceed directly to the fire location, while medical units mobilize to handle casualties. Simultaneously, police units begin implementing traffic management procedures as needed.

### Parallel Operations

The execution phase involves multiple specialized operations occurring concurrently. The Firefighting team conducts both primary firefighting operations and rescue missions when required. The Medical team focuses on providing immediate medical treatment and coordinating patient transportation to appropriate facilities. The Police team maintains area security through regular patrols while managing traffic flow around the incident site.

### Real-time Coordination

Throughout the operation, all units maintain constant communication by providing regular status updates. This dynamic approach ensures effective inter-team coordination and optimal resource utilization throughout the emergency response.

## 5. Incident Resolution

### Final Checks

Once the immediate emergency is addressed, the firefighting team confirms complete fire extinction. All actuator agents then perform thorough final checks of their respective areas of responsibility. Each team methodically verifies that their specific objectives have been fully met according to the response plan.

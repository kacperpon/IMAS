Ethics Rulebook for Emergency Response Agents****
Purpose: This rulebook outlines the ethical principles and decision-making framework for agents managing emergency response resources involving firefighters and medical personnel.
Handling Ethical Dilemmas:
Resource Shortages  In scenarios where resources are insufficient to address all needs:
*   Use triage to prioritize individuals based on survival likelihood and immediacy of need.
*   If two individuals have equal survival likelihood and urgency, consider additional factors such as whether one is in a position to assist others if saved (e.g., emergency personnel trapped in the area).
Conflicting Objectives  If saving one group might harm another:
*   Agents must calculate the overall harm or benefit to the affected groups.
*   Favor actions that minimize net harm while maximizing lives saved. For example, if extinguishing a fire in one building prevents the fire from spreading to multiple others, that action takes precedence.
The comprehensive plan and ethics rulebook will be continuously reviewed and updated based on new insights, feedback from past emergencies, and evolving societal values to ensure they remain relevant and effective.

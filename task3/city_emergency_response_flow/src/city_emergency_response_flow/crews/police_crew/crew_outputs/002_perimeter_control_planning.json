The action plan includes: (1) securing a perimeter around the fire location to prevent civilian access and ensure firefighter safety, (2) diverting traffic away from Calle San Francisco to adjacent roads such as Avenida del Puerto or Calle General Muñoz Castellanos to minimize congestion and prevent accidents, (3) setting up checkpoints at intersections like Plaza de la Constitución and Plaza San Antonio to control the flow of vehicles and pedestrians, (4) coordinating with firefighting teams to ensure a safe and efficient operation, and (5) maintaining open communication lines with emergency services and local authorities to adapt the response as necessary based on real-time updates."}

{"ordered_victim_rescue":[{"victim_id":"Victim 1","condition":"Severe burns and potential electrical shock","priority_level":"High"},{"victim_id":"Victim 2","condition":"Moderate injuries, possible smoke inhalation","priority_level":"Medium"},{"victim_id":"Victim 3","condition":"Mild injuries, minor cuts and bruises","priority_level":"Low"}],"action_details":"The prioritization of victims for rescue is based on the severity of their conditions and the potential for further harm if not rescued promptly. Victim 1 is given the highest priority due to severe burns and potential electrical shock, which requires immediate medical attention to prevent further complications. Victim 2 has moderate injuries and possible smoke inhalation, making them the second priority as they need timely medical care to avoid worsening their condition. Victim 3, with mild injuries, is the third priority but still needs to be rescued and provided with medical assistance as soon as possible to ensure their safety and prevent any potential escalation of their condition. The rescue strategy involves using Fire-Resistant Blankets for protection during removal from the fire scene and allocating 4 firefighters for rescue and medical assistance. This approach ensures that all injured individuals receive the necessary care in a timely manner, taking into account the severity of the electrical fire and the need to minimize risks to both the victims and the rescue personnel."}

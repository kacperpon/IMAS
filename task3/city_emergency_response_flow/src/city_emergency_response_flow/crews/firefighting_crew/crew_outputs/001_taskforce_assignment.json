{"n_firefighters":15,"action_details":"For an electrical fire at Calle San Francisco, CÃ¡diz, Spain with 3 injured people and high estimated severity, we need to allocate a significant taskforce. The electrical nature of the fire requires specialized equipment and trained personnel to handle potential electrical hazards. Given the location in a possibly densely populated urban area, ensuring public safety is paramount. The allocation includes: 5 firefighters for initial attack and suppression using appropriate electrical fire-fighting techniques and equipment, 4 firefighters for rescue and medical assistance to tend to the injured, 3 firefighters for ventilation and smoke removal to improve visibility and reduce hazards, 2 firefighters for salvage and overhaul to prevent re-ignition and minimize property damage, and 1 officer for command and control to coordinate efforts and ensure a unified response strategy. This allocation ensures both effective fire suppression and adequate medical and rescue support."}

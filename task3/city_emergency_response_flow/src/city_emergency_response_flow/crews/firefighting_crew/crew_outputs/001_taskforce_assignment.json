{"n_firefighters":10,"action_details":"Upon arriving at the scene, assess the situation and confirm the severity of the electrical fire. Since it's a high-severity fire in a residential area with three injured people (one unconscious and two with burns), we need to allocate a significant number of personnel for safety and efficient firefighting. We'll assign four firefighters for initial damage control, two for medical assistance and patient care, and four more for further extinguishing the fire while protecting adjacent areas. Additionally, one team will be stationed outside as backup support in case of any emergencies or equipment malfunctions. This allocation ensures a comprehensive approach to handling this complex situation, prioritizing both safety and effective firefighting."}

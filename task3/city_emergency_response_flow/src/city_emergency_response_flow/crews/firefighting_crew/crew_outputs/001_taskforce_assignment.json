{"n_firefighters":6,"action_details":"For this emergency, we will allocate 6 firefighters due to the following considerations. Since it's a gas fire in a specific location (Calle San Francisco, CÃ¡diz), we should consider potential risks from gas leaks and confined spaces. However, with no injured people reported and an estimated low severity level, we can initially deploy a smaller team for assessment and initial suppression efforts. The allocated team will consist of 2 officers to oversee the operation and assess the situation. Another 2 firefighters will be assigned for structural ventilation and fire containment, given the urban location and potential exposure risks. Lastly, 1 firefighter each for gas detection equipment operation and another for providing support as needed based on evolving conditions during the response."}

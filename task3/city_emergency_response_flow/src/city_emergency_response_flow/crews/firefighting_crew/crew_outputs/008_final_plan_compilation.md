The high-severity electrical fire in a residential area with three injured people (one unconscious and two with burns) requires an immediate response. 

1. **Victim Rescue**: Assign four firefighters for initial damage control, two for medical assistance and patient care, and four more for further extinguishing the fire while protecting adjacent areas.
2. **Firefighting Tools**:
   - The Dry Chemical Extinguisher is suitable for Class A, B, and C fires, making it an initial choice.
   - For high-severity electrical fires with involved fuel sources, the Water Mist Extinguisher is highly effective due to its ability to cool the surrounding area quickly and effectively suppress flames without spreading water damage.
   - In cases where flammable liquids are present or there's a risk of fire spreading, the Foam Extinguisher can be used due to its excellent performance against Class B fires.

3. **Fire Trucks**:
   - Three fire trucks with necessary tools for high-severity electrical fires and available for deployment: 
     - Truck 1 (Truck ID: 1) has a Dry Chemical Extinguisher, Water Mist Extinguisher, is located at [36.5327,-6.302902], and its status is "Available".
     - Truck 3 (Truck ID: 3) has a Dry Chemical Extinguisher, Foam Extinguisher, is located at [36.524114,-6.286088], and its status is "Available".
     - Truck 6 (Truck ID: 6) has a Water Mist Extinguisher, Dry Chemical Extinguisher, is located at [36.511723,-6.271585], and its status is "Available".

4. **Route Planning**: Route planning was successful with estimated durations:
   - The duration from the starting point to Truck 1 (Truck ID: 1) would be approximately 3.35 minutes.
   - The duration from the starting point to Truck 3 (Truck ID: 3) would be approximately 2.85 minutes.
   - The duration from the starting point to Truck 6 (Truck ID: 6) would be approximately 5.3 minutes.

This comprehensive approach prioritizes both safety and effective firefighting, ensuring a timely response to the high-severity electrical fire in a residential area with three injured people.

{"rescue_strategy":"The rescue strategy involves prioritizing the safety of the 3 injured people. Given the location of the fire at Av. Campo del Sur, 262, Cadiz, Spain and its high-severity rating, a coordinated effort is necessary to minimize risks and ensure effective rescue operations. Initially, dispatch a team equipped with thermal imaging cameras and insulated gloves to assess the situation and identify safe entry points for rescuers. Utilize communication equipment to coordinate efforts and establish clear protocols for extraction. \n Once the injured individuals are identified and located, deploy a specialized rescue team utilizing necessary safety gear and support equipment (e.g., stretchers, oxygen supply) to carefully transport them to a safe area where medical professionals can provide aid. Throughout this process, maintain continuous communication with incident command to ensure seamless integration of rescue efforts with firefighting operations.\n \n  A thorough risk assessment is crucial to guarantee the success of the rescue mission without exacerbating the fire's spread or putting additional personnel at risk.","stop_fire_strategy":"The fire suppression strategy involves employing a multi-faceted approach tailored to the high-severity electrical fire at Av. Campo del Sur, 262, Cadiz, Spain. Deploy an initial attack team equipped with Electrical Non-Conductive Fire Extinguishers and Insulated Gloves for enhanced safety while tackling the source of the fire.\n Utilize thermal imaging cameras to identify hotspots and smoldering areas that might require targeted application of firefighting foam or additional extinguishing agents. Given the high-severity rating, maintain a consistent water supply and utilize it effectively in conjunction with other suppression methods (e.g., firefighting foam).\n \n Continuously monitor temperature fluctuations, smoke density, and structural integrity to adjust tactics accordingly, ensuring effective control of the fire without compromising safety.","action_details":"Given the severity of this electrical fire and the need for precise coordination between rescue and firefighting efforts, it is crucial to integrate Incident Command System (ICS) protocols. Assign specific roles to each team member or unit involved in the operation.\n Utilize specialized equipment such as thermal imaging cameras for hotspot identification, and Insulated Gloves for safe approach to live electrical sources. Ensure that all personnel are aware of potential risks, including arc flash hazards, and take necessary precautions.\n For effective communication among teams, establish designated communication channels utilizing radio frequencies or other forms of digital communication systems tailored to the environment and equipment being used.\n \n Given the number of injured people, coordinate closely with local medical services for timely evacuation and treatment. As part of the action plan, designate a logistical support team responsible for maintaining and supplying necessary equipment, managing resource allocation, and facilitating smooth communication among all participating units."}

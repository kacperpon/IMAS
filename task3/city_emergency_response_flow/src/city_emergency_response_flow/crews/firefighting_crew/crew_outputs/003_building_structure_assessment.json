{"rescue_strategy":"Establish a safe perimeter around the building to prevent further injuries. Assess the condition of the injured individuals, prioritizing medical attention for the unconscious person while providing basic care for those with burns and respiratory distress. Utilize personal protective equipment (PPE) for firefighters to ensure their safety during rescue operations. Conduct a thorough assessment of the structural integrity of the building, considering factors such as fire spread, potential collapse risks, and the stability of supporting structures like walls, floors, and beams.","stop_fire_strategy":"Initially deploy the Dry Chemical Extinguisher due to its versatility in combating Class A, B, and C fires. Once the fire's severity is assessed, consider deploying the Water Mist Extinguisher for high-severity electrical fires with involved fuel sources. If flammable liquids are present or there's a risk of fire spreading, use the Foam Extinguisher. Continuously monitor the situation and adjust firefighting strategies as necessary.","action_details":"Given the high-severity electrical fire in a residential area with injured people, we need to prioritize using extinguishing tools that are effective against Class C fires (electrical fires), as well as those that minimize damage and risk of injury. The Dry Chemical Extinguisher is suitable for Class A, B, and C fires, making it an initial choice. For high-severity electrical fires with involved fuel sources (e.g., furniture or wood), the Water Mist Extinguisher is highly effective due to its ability to cool the surrounding area quickly and effectively suppress flames without spreading water damage. In cases where flammable liquids are involved or there's a risk of fire spreading, the Foam Extinguisher can be used due to its excellent performance against Class B fires."}

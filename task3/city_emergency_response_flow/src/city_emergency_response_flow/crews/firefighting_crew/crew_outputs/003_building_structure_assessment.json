{"rescue_strategy":"Develop a rescue plan in conjunction with local emergency services. Given the three injured individuals and high estimated fire severity, prioritize their evacuation while maintaining a safe distance from the fire to prevent exposure to potential electrical shock or falling debris. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for rescuers, such as helmets, gloves, and safety glasses. Consider using thermal imaging cameras (TICs) to locate and monitor individuals in the building without risking further injury.","stop_fire_strategy":"Employ a multi-stage fire suppression strategy: Initially use Dry chemical extinguishers for their effectiveness against electrical fires and versatility against Class A fires. Be cautious with foam agents due to potential water damage risks on electrical equipment. If the initial attack does not fully extinguish the fire, consider using Class C extinguishers or multi-purpose dry chemical extinguishers as supplementary tools. Monitor fire behavior closely and adjust strategies accordingly.","action_details":"Given the high estimated fire severity and the fact that it's an electrical fire, it's crucial to select appropriate extinguishing tools. The most relevant ones in this scenario would be Dry chemical extinguishers, which are effective against Class C (electrical) fires and can also be used for Class A fires. Foam agents could be considered as a supplementary tool but with caution due to the potential for water damage from foam on electrical equipment. It's essential to follow the PASS method when using these tools: Pull the safety pin or ring, Aim the nozzle at the base of the fire, Squeeze the handle to release the extinguishing agent, and Sweep the nozzle back and forth, covering the entire area with the extinguishing agent."}

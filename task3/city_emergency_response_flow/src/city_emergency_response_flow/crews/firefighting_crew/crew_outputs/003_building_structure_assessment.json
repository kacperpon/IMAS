{"rescue_strategy":"Conduct a thorough assessment of the building's structure to identify safe entry points. Deploy thermal imaging cameras to detect any potential hotspots or hazards within the building. Once inside, establish a clear communication system with team members to ensure coordination and safety. Prioritize evacuation routes and designate a primary escape route for all occupants. Utilize self-contained breathing apparatuses (SCBA) for personnel to navigate smoke-filled areas safely. As rescue operations progress, continue to monitor structural integrity and adjust strategies as needed.","stop_fire_strategy":"Apply the 'defend in place' strategy by deploying foam agents or dry chemical extinguishers from a safe distance to prevent fire spread while evacuation is ongoing. Utilize water hoses for cooling purposes to reduce heat load on adjacent structures and maintain an exterior perimeter to contain the fire. Continuously monitor temperature, smoke density, and potential ignition sources, adjusting suppression methods accordingly.","action_details":"To assess structural integrity, a team of engineers will inspect the building's foundation, columns, beams, and any other critical components for signs of damage or weakness. They'll analyze data from thermal imaging cameras to identify areas where heat has compromised structural elements. Based on these findings, a plan will be developed to either proceed with evacuation as planned or modify rescue strategies to accommodate potential hazards."}

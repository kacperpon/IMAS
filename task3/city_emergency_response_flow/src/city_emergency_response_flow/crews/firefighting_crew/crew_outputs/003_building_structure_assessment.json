{"rescue_strategy":"Perform a thorough assessment of the building's structural integrity before initiating rescue operations. Given that the fire severity is estimated as Low and there are no injured people, it is likely that the building remains relatively stable. However, caution should be exercised to avoid any potential hazards. The first step would be to ventilate the area using powerful fans or other means to reduce smoke and heat, allowing for a clearer path for rescue teams. Next, assess the structural elements of the building, such as beams, columns, and walls, for signs of damage or instability. This may involve inspecting the building from the outside, looking for visible cracks or weaknesses in the structure. If any vulnerabilities are identified, adjust the rescue strategy accordingly to minimize risks. For example, if a column is weakened, it might be necessary to establish a temporary support system before proceeding with the rescue. Utilize personal protective equipment (PPE) for all team members and ensure they follow established safety protocols.","stop_fire_strategy":"To effectively suppress the fire, we should employ a combination of extinguishing tools based on the type of gas involved and the specific conditions at the scene. First, deploy Halogenated extinguishers to target the gas and flammable liquids directly, given their effectiveness against Class B fires. Simultaneously, activate the water mist system to disperse the fire while reducing heat release rates in the confined space. If necessary, utilize inert gases such as CO2 or N2 to smother the Class B fire by displacing oxygen. Lastly, have portable extinguishers containing foam agents ready for deployment in case of an electrical component ignition or if the situation escalates.","action_details":"To effectively address the fire and initiate rescue operations, follow these detailed steps: 1) Conduct a thorough risk assessment to identify any structural vulnerabilities or potential hazards within the building. This involves inspecting the building's structural elements for damage or instability. 2) Once you have assessed the situation and identified potential risks, develop a customized plan that adjusts rescue strategies to accommodate any necessary precautions. For example, if you find damaged beams or columns, create a temporary support system before proceeding with the rescue. 3) Ensure all team members are equipped with PPE, following established safety protocols to protect themselves from hazardous conditions. 4) Start by ventilating the area using powerful fans or other means to reduce smoke and heat, making it safer for your team to navigate the building. 5) Employ a combination of extinguishing tools to suppress the fire effectively, targeting gas and flammable liquids with Halogenated extinguishers while also activating water mist systems and having inert gases or foam agents ready for deployment as needed."}

{"rescue_strategy":"The rescue strategy will involve a combination of evacuation and search-and-rescue operations. Given the severity of the fire and its location in a residential area with multiple story buildings, we will prioritize evacuating people from the surrounding buildings and creating a safe perimeter around the burning building. Once the fire is under control, trained rescue teams will enter the building to search for anyone who may still be trapped. We will use thermal imaging cameras and other specialized equipment to locate individuals and navigate through the smoke-filled environment.","stop_fire_strategy":"Our strategy for stopping the fire will focus on using foam agents to effectively combat the flames, given their ability to penetrate deep into burning materials and starve fires of oxygen. Water fog nozzles will be deployed to tackle the main body of the fire while keeping people safe from falling debris and smoke inhalation. Additionally, Class A fire extinguishers will be used for any smoldering embers or hotspots that may arise during the firefighting efforts.","action_details":"Based on the high severity of the fire and its location in a residential area with multiple story buildings, we will use foam agents to effectively combat the flames.

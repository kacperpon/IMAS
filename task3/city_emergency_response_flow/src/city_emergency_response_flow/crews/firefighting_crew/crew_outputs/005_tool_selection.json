{"firefighting_tools":["Dry Chemical Extinguisher","Water Mist Extinguisher","Foam Extinguisher","Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)","Respiratory protection equipment for firefighters"],"action_details":"The selected firefighting tools are chosen based on the high-severity electrical fire scenario. The Dry Chemical Extinguisher is an initial choice due to its versatility in combating Class A, B, and C fires. However, for high-severity electrical fires with involved fuel sources, the Water Mist Extinguisher is highly effective in cooling the surrounding area quickly and suppressing flames without spreading water damage. In cases where flammable liquids are present or there's a risk of fire spreading, the Foam Extinguisher can be used due to its excellent performance against Class B fires. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for firefighters is essential to ensure their safety during rescue operations, as they will need protection from heat, smoke, and potential electrical hazards. Respiratory protection equipment for firefighters is also necessary to prevent them from inhaling harmful fumes and particles."}

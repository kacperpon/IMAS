{"firefighting_tools":["Halogenated extinguishers","Water mist system","CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) or N2 (Nitrogen) inert gases","Foam agents for portable extinguishers","Powerful fans for ventilation"],"action_details":"Given the specifics of this scenario, we need to carefully manage our tool selection based on the low fire severity and gas as the fire type. First, we'll use Halogenated extinguishers for effective targeting against Class B fires involving gas and flammable liquids. In parallel, activate the water mist system to control heat release rates in the confined space. If necessary, deploy CO2 or N2 inert gases to smother the fire by displacing oxygen. For added safety, have foam agents ready in portable extinguishers for potential electrical component ignition or escalated situations. Meanwhile, utilize powerful fans for thorough ventilation of the area, reducing smoke and heat to create a safer environment for rescue operations."}

{"firefighting_tools":["Thermal imaging camera (TIC)","Multi-purpose dry chemical extinguisher","Class C extinguisher","Helmet","Gloves","Safety glasses"],"action_details":"To supplement the initial response, we need to consider additional tools for effective fire suppression and rescue operations. A thermal imaging camera (TIC) will aid in locating and monitoring individuals within the building without risking further injury. For enhanced fire suppression capabilities, a multi-purpose dry chemical extinguisher can be used as a supplementary tool to address potential Class B fires. Additionally, we should have a Class C extinguisher on standby for electrical fires. Given the high estimated fire severity and the electrical nature of the fire, proper personal protective equipment (PPE) is crucial for rescuers, including helmets, gloves, and safety glasses."}

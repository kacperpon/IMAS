{"firefighting_tools":["Thermal imaging camera","Water fog nozzle","Class A fire extinguishers","Foam agent tank","Smoke hood","Rescue rope and harness","First aid kit"],"action_details":"Given the severity of the fire and its location in a residential area with multiple story buildings, we will prioritize evacuating people from the surrounding buildings and creating a safe perimeter around the burning building. We will use thermal imaging cameras to locate individuals and navigate through the smoke-filled environment. Once the fire is under control, trained rescue teams will enter the building to search for anyone who may still be trapped. Foam agents will be used to effectively combat the flames, and water fog nozzles will be deployed to tackle the main body of the fire while keeping people safe from falling debris and smoke inhalation. Class A fire extinguishers will be used for any smoldering embers or hotspots that may arise during the firefighting efforts. Smoke hoods will be provided for rescue teams to prevent smoke inhalation, and rescue ropes and harnesses will be used for safe entry into the building. First aid kits will also be available in case of any injuries."}

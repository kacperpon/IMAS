Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Extinguishers, Dry Chemical Extinguishers, and Clean Agent Extinguishers are used for fire suppression due to their ability to displace oxygen, smother the fire, and cool equipment without damaging sensitive electrical components. Fire-Resistant Blankets are utilized for protecting people from flames during rescue operations and potentially smothering smaller fires. Thermal Imaging Cameras help in identifying hot spots and individuals trapped inside. Electrical Fire Fighting Suits provide protection to firefighters from electrical hazards. Rescue Stretchers and First Aid Kits are essential for the safe evacuation and medical assistance of the injured. Ventilation Fans and Smoke Removal Equipment improve visibility and reduce respiratory hazards, facilitating a safer operating environment for both firefighters and those being rescued. The combination of these tools enables an efficient and effective response to the electrical fire, prioritizing both fire suppression and rescue operations."}

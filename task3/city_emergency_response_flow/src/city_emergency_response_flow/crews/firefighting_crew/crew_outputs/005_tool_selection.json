{"firefighting_tools":["Thermal imaging cameras","Self-contained breathing apparatuses (SCBA)","Foam agents","Dry chemical extinguishers","Water hoses"],"action_details":"Based on the given rescue and fire suppression strategies, I selected these tools for their critical roles in ensuring safe entry into smoke-filled areas, detecting hotspots, preventing fire spread, cooling affected structures, and maintaining an exterior perimeter to contain the fire. The thermal imaging cameras are essential for identifying potential hazards within the building, while SCBA enable personnel to navigate safely through smoke-filled areas. Foam agents or dry chemical extinguishers can be used from a safe distance to prevent fire spread during evacuation, and water hoses will aid in cooling purposes to reduce heat load on adjacent structures."}

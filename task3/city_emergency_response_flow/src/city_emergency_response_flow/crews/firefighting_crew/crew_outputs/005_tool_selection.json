Assign specific roles to each team member or unit involved in the operation. Utilize specialized equipment such as thermal imaging cameras for hotspot identification, and Insulated Gloves for safe approach to live electrical sources. Ensure that all personnel are aware of potential risks, including arc flash hazards, and take necessary precautions. For effective communication among teams, establish designated communication channels utilizing radio frequencies or other forms of digital communication systems tailored to the environment and equipment being used. Given the number of injured people, coordinate closely with local medical services for timely evacuation and treatment. As part of the action plan, designate a logistical support team responsible for maintaining and supplying necessary equipment, managing resource allocation, and facilitating smooth communication among all participating units."}

{"extinguishing_tools":["Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Extinguishers","Dry Chemical Extinguishers","Clean Agent Extinguishers","Fire-Resistant Blankets"],"action_details":"For an electrical fire at Calle San Francisco, CÃ¡diz, Spain with 3 injured people and high estimated severity, we need to allocate a significant taskforce. The electrical nature of the fire requires specialized equipment and trained personnel to handle potential electrical hazards. Given the location in a possibly densely populated urban area, ensuring public safety is paramount. Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Extinguishers are effective for electrical fires as they displace oxygen and cool the equipment without leaving residue. Dry Chemical Extinguishers can also be used on electrical fires by smothering the fire and preventing it from spreading. Clean Agent Extinguishers are another option, providing a non-conductive and non-corrosive extinguishing agent that won't damage sensitive electrical equipment. Fire-Resistant Blankets can be used to smother smaller electrical fires or to protect people from flames during rescue operations. The allocation includes: 5 firefighters for initial attack and suppression using these appropriate electrical fire-fighting techniques and equipment, 4 firefighters for rescue and medical assistance to tend to the injured, 3 firefighters for ventilation and smoke removal to improve visibility and reduce hazards, 2 firefighters for salvage and overhaul to prevent re-ignition and minimize property damage, and 1 officer for command and control to coordinate efforts and ensure a unified response strategy. This allocation ensures both effective fire suppression and adequate medical and rescue support."}

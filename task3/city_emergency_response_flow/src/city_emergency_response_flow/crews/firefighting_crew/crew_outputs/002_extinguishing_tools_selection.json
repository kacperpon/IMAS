{"extinguishing_tools":["Dry chemical extinguishers","Foam agents (for Class A fires)","Class C extinguishers or multi-purpose dry chemical extinguishers suitable for electrical equipment fires"],"action_details":"Given the high estimated fire severity and the fact that it's an electrical fire, it's crucial to select appropriate extinguishing tools. The most relevant ones in this scenario would be Dry chemical extinguishers, which are effective against Class C (electrical) fires and can also be used for Class A fires. Foam agents could be considered as a supplementary tool but with caution due to the potential for water damage from foam on electrical equipment. It's essential to follow the PASS method when using these tools: Pull the safety pin or ring, Aim the nozzle at the base of the fire, Squeeze the handle to release the extinguishing agent, and Sweep the nozzle back and forth, covering the entire area with the extinguishing agent."}

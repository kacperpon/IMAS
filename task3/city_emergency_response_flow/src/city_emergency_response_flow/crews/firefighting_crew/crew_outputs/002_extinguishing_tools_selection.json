{"extinguishing_tools":["Water Hose","Foam Agent","Dry Chemical Extinguisher"],"action_details":"For a fire in a densely populated area with multiple potential hazards, we need to prioritize caution. Based on the expected level of complexity and risk involved, we will use a combination of water hose for flooding and cooling, foam agent to smother the fire, and dry chemical extinguishers as a backup measure in case the primary tools are insufficient or unavailable. The team should be equipped with these tools and work together seamlessly to tackle the fire effectively."}

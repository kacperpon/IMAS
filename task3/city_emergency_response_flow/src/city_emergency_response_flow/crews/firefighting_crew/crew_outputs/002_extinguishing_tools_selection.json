{"extinguishing_tools":["Dry Chemical Extinguisher","Water Mist Extinguisher","Foam Extinguisher"],"action_details":"Given the high-severity electrical fire in a residential area with injured people, we need to prioritize using extinguishing tools that are effective against Class C fires (electrical fires), as well as those that minimize damage and risk of injury. The Dry Chemical Extinguisher is suitable for Class A, B, and C fires, making it an initial choice. For high-severity electrical fires with involved fuel sources (e.g., furniture or wood), the Water Mist Extinguisher is highly effective due to its ability to cool the surrounding area quickly and effectively suppress flames without spreading water damage. In cases where flammable liquids are involved or there's a risk of fire spreading, the Foam Extinguisher can be used due to its excellent performance against Class B fires."}

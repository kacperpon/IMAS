{"extinguishing_tools":["Halogenated extinguishers (e.g., Halon or similar alternatives) for Class B fires, specifically targeting gas and flammable liquids","Water mist systems to disperse the fire while also reducing heat release rates in a confined space like Calle San Francisco, Cádiz","Inert gases such as CO2 or N2 to smother Class B fires by displacing oxygen","Portable extinguishers containing foam agents for tackling gas fires in urban settings and minimizing collateral damage"],"action_details":"To effectively address the fire, it is crucial to utilize appropriate extinguishing tools based on the type of gas involved. Given that this is a Class B (flammable liquid) or Class C (electrical) fire involving gas, Halogenated extinguishers should be used first due to their effectiveness against these types. Additionally, considering the urban setting and risk of exposure, we must ensure proper ventilation. Water mist systems are ideal for such scenarios as they disperse the fire while reducing heat release rates in a confined space like Calle San Francisco, Cádiz. Lastly, inert gases or foam agents should be deployed to smother the gas fire and prevent its spread."}

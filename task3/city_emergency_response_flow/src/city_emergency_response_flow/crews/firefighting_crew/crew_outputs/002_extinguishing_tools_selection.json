{"extinguishing_tools":["Electrical Non-Conductive Fire Extinguisher","Thermal Imaging Camera","Insulated Gloves","Firefighting Foam"],"action_details":"For an electrical fire at Av. Campo del Sur, 262, Cadiz, Spain with a high-severity rating and 3 injured people, the most suitable extinguishing tools would be: \n- Electrical Non-Conductive Fire Extinguisher: This specialized extinguisher is designed for electrical fires and prevents re-ignition by not allowing electricity to pass through it. It should be used with caution to avoid any electrical shock.\n- Thermal Imaging Camera: To detect hotspots and identify areas where the fire may still be smoldering, a thermal imaging camera would provide crucial information for effective extinguishing efforts.\n- Insulated Gloves: Given the high severity of the fire and potential electrical hazards, insulated gloves will protect firefighters' hands from electrical shocks or heat while conducting operations.\n- Firefighting Foam: As an additional measure to starve the fire of oxygen and cool the surrounding area, firefighting foam can be used. However, it should only be applied after ensuring the safety of all individuals involved and taking into account any potential environmental concerns. \n\nAction Plan:\n1. Initial attack: Deploy the initial attack team to Av. Campo del Sur, 262, to contain the fire and prevent further spread. Ensure proper ventilation is provided to reduce smoke and heat intensity.\n2. Rescue efforts: Dispatch a rescue team to assist the injured people, prioritizing their safety and medical attention.\n3. Electrical safety precautions: Conduct an electrical risk assessment to ensure the firefighting operation does not exacerbate the fire's spread. Utilize specialized equipment (e.g., insulated gloves, thermal imaging cameras) for enhanced safety.\n4. Water supply management: Establish a reliable water supply system to maintain a consistent flow of water to combat the high-severity fire.\n5. Support staff: Coordinate communication with local emergency services, manage incident logistics, and provide tactical support for the firefighting operation."}

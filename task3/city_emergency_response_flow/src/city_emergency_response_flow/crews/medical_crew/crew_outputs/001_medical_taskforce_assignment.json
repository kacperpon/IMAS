{"n_doctors":6,"action_details":"Given the high severity of the electrical fire incident at Calle San Francisco, CÃ¡diz, Spain, with 3 injured people, and considering the potential for severe burns and electrical injuries, it's crucial to allocate a sufficient number of doctors. The location's distance from major hospitals and the uncertainty of hospital capacity necessitate a robust initial response. Therefore, I recommend assigning 6 doctors to this emergency: 2 emergency medicine specialists for immediate triage and stabilization, 2 burn specialists given the nature of the fire, and 2 general surgeons for potential surgical interventions. This team will provide comprehensive care, covering urgent needs, burn treatment, and any necessary surgeries. They will also facilitate efficient transportation to a hospital if needed, ensuring the best possible outcomes for the injured individuals."}

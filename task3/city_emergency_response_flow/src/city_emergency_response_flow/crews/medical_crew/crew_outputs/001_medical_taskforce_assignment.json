{"n_doctors":5,"action_details":"Based on the emergency information provided, a total of 3 individuals are injured with varying levels of severity. Considering the unconscious person and those with burns, immediate medical attention is required to stabilize their condition. Additionally, the presence of coughing suggests potential respiratory issues that need to be addressed. To ensure effective response, we will assign a team consisting of 5 doctors: 2 for stabilizing critical patients (unconscious person and those with severe burns), 1 for treating minor injuries, 1 for managing respiratory conditions, and 1 as a backup for any further complications or to assist in triage if needed. Upon arrival, the medical crew will assess each patient's condition, prioritize treatment based on severity, and allocate resources accordingly."}

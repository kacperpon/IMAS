{"response_plan":"The closest ambulances to the emergency location are Ambulance 1 and Ambulance 6. However, based on the prioritization of victims, the following steps should be taken:\n\n1. Victim 1, who has severe burns and is unconscious, should be transported to Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar as soon as possible.\n2. Victim 2, also unconscious, requires a high level of care and should be sent to Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar for treatment.\n3. Victim 3, with coughing symptoms and minor injuries, can be treated at Hospital Pascual San Rafael.\n\nTo facilitate the transportation of these patients, I will use the provided route information:\n\n* For Victim 1 (severe burns and unconscious), Ambulance 1 should take the route to Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar as described in the “oroutes” section of the provided data.\n* For Victim 2 (unconscious and requiring high-level care), Ambulance 6 should follow a similar route to Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar, possibly taking the second part of the route from Ambulance 1's journey.\n* For Victim 3 (coughing symptoms and minor injuries), Ambulance 4 or another available ambulance can take the route to Hospital Pascual San Rafael as described.\n\nAdditionally, I will ensure that all necessary medical equipment and supplies are on board each ambulance, and that emergency responders are prepared for any potential complications during transport. Upon arrival at their designated hospitals, the patients will receive immediate attention from medical staff, who will assess their conditions and provide appropriate treatment.","ethical_issues":null,"action_details":"All necessary medical equipment and supplies are on board each ambulance, and emergency responders are prepared for any potential complications during transport."}

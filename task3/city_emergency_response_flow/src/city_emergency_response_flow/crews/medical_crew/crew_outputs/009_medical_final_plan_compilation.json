{"response_plan":"To determine which hospitals can accommodate ambulances based on available bed capacity and proximity, the following steps should be taken:1. Extract relevant information about hospital locations (latitude and longitude) and available bed capacities from the data structure `data = {...}` provided earlier.2. Use a geospatial analysis tool to calculate the distance between each hospital location and the ambulanceâ€™s current location.3. Filter the list of hospitals based on their available bed capacity and proximity to the ambulance.4. Rank the filtered list of hospitals based on their proximity to the ambulance, with the closest hospital being ranked highest.By following these steps, we can identify which hospitals can accommodate ambulances based on available bed capacity and proximity, ensuring that emergency medical services are provided efficiently and effectively.","ethical_issues":null,"action_details":"This plan outlines a step-by-step approach to determine suitable hospitals for ambulance allocation based on their capacity and proximity."}

The defibrillator is essential for treating cardiac arrests, while oxygen tanks and masks are crucial for patients experiencing respiratory distress. Stretcher or gurneys will facilitate efficient patient transportation. For fracture management, splints and bandages should be readily available. Surgical gloves and instruments will enable the medical team to perform surgeries effectively. Anesthesia equipment and pain management medications will aid in pain control and anesthesia administration. IV fluids and administration sets will allow for fluid resuscitation and medication delivery. Wound closure strips and skin glue will help with wound care, while tourniquets and hemostatic agents may be necessary for severe bleeding control. Lastly, first aid kits will provide basic supplies for initial patient assessment and treatment."}

The burn dressings, antibiotic ointments, and pain relief medication will help manage symptoms and prevent infection. Oxygen tanks and masks are essential for ensuring adequate oxygen supply to patients with respiratory distress due to smoke inhalation or severe burns. A defibrillator is necessary in case of cardiac arrest caused by electrical shock. Tourniquets should be used sparingly as they can cause more harm than good in most burn cases. Splints and bandages will aid in stabilizing any broken bones, while irrigation solutions will help clean wounds. Burn creams or gels will provide further protection against infection and promote wound healing."}

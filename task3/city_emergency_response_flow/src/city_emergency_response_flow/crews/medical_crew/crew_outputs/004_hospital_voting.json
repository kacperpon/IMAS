The highest number of votes (2) has been given to Hospital Pascual San Rafael due to its high bed capacity (20) and presence of 'Trauma' and 'Burn Unit' specializations which are relevant for electrical fire victims with estimated high incident severity. Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar and Dr L贸pez Cano have received one vote each as they have sufficient capacities (25 and 15 beds respectively) but do not specialize in Trauma or Burn Units. Quir贸nsalud Campo de Gibraltar has zero votes due to its limited capacity of only 10 beds."}

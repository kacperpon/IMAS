I encountered an error while trying to use the tool. This was the error: list index out of range.
 Tool hospital_route_tool accepts these inputs: Tool Name: hospital_route_tool
Tool Arguments: {'hospital_names': {'description': 'Stringified list of the hospital names.', 'type': 'str'}, 'origin_lat': {'description': 'Latitude of the emergency/incident location.', 'type': 'float'}, 'origin_lon': {'description': 'Longitude of the emergency/incident location.', 'type': 'float'}, 'destination_lats': {'description': 'Stringified list of the Latitudes of all hosptial locations.', 'type': 'str'}, 'destination_lons': {'description': 'Stringified list of the Longitudes of all hospital locations.', 'type': 'str'}}
Tool Description: This tool calculates an optimal route from an origin to a destination for different emergency vehicles using OSMnx and networkx..
Moving on then. I MUST either use a tool (use one at time) OR give my best final answer not both at the same time. To Use the following format:

Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [hospital_route_tool]
Action Input: the input to the action, dictionary enclosed in curly braces
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Result can repeat N times)
Thought: I now can give a great answer
Final Answer: Your final answer must be the great and the most complete as possible, it must be outcome described

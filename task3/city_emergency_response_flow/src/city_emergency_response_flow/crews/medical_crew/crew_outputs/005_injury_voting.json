The Trauma Center (Hospital ID: 2) received the most votes due to its specialized care for severe trauma cases, which aligns with the majority's assessment that there will be a high influx of critical patients requiring immediate attention. General Hospital (Hospital ID: 1) was the second choice as it has sufficient capacity to accommodate various types of injuries and surgeries. Children's Hospital (Hospital ID: 3), although ideal for pediatric emergencies, did not receive any votes due to its lower capacity compared to other facilities."}

The unconscious individual (Victim ID: 1) requires immediate attention at Hospital Quirónsalud Campo de Gibraltar due to its Burn Unit specialization. Victims 2 and 3, who have burns and are coughing heavily, also require specialized care at Hospital Quirónsalud Campo de Gibraltar, with Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar serving as a secondary option for each of them."}

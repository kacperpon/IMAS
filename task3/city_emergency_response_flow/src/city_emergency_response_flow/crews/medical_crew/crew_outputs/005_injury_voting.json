Given the high severity of the incident and the number of injured people (3), hospitals with higher available bed capacities and relevant specializations such as Trauma, Emergency, and Intensive Care Unit were prioritized. Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar received 3 votes due to its high available bed capacity and relevant specializations (Trauma, Cardiology, Neurology). Hospital Dr López Cano received 2 votes because of its moderate available bed capacity and important specializations (Emergency, Intensive Care Unit, Cardiology). Hospital Pascual San Rafael got 1 vote as it has a lower available bed capacity but still offers necessary specializations (Trauma, Burn Unit, Oncology). Hospital Quirónsalud Campo de Gibraltar received 0 votes due to its low available bed capacity and although it has an Intensive Care Unit and Burn Unit, its distance from the incident location is farther compared to the other options. All hospitals were considered based on their capacities and the context provided."}

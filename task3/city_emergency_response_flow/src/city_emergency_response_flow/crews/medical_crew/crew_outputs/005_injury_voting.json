For each victim, I have allocated votes to hospitals that can accommodate them with sufficient capacity and specializations relevant to their condition. Hospital Pascual San Rafael has received three votes for all victims due to its high bed capacity (20) and presence of 'Trauma' and 'Burn Unit' specializations which are essential for electrical fire victims with estimated high incident severity. The remaining hospitals have been allocated one vote each based on their capacities, except Quirónsalud Campo de Gibraltar with zero votes due to limited capacity."}
